# KapadokyaReservation - AI-Powered Hotel Booking System

> **Note:** This project was developed for the Kapadokya Hackathon with a focus on rapid development. While some minor enhancements were made post-hackathon, the project primarily demonstrates the core concepts and integration capabilities rather than production-level polish.

## Project Overview

KapadokyaReservation is a full-stack hotel reservation system that uniquely integrates a conversational AI agent to guide users through the entire booking process. This project demonstrates how modern AI technologies can be integrated with traditional booking systems to create a seamless, intuitive user experience.

### Key Features

- **Conversational AI Booking Flow**: Complete hotel reservations through natural language conversation with an AI agent
- **Spring Boot Backend**: Robust API with comprehensive hotel management functionality
- **Keycloak Integration**: Enterprise-grade authentication and authorization
- **React Native Mobile App**: Cross-platform mobile application built with Expo
- **AI Recommendation System**: Personalized room suggestions based on user preferences

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Spring Boot**: Java-based backend framework for robust API development
- **Keycloak**: Open-source identity and access management solution
- **JPA/Hibernate**: ORM for database interactions
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for data persistence

### AI Components
- **Google ADK**: AI agent development framework
- **Custom AI Tools**: Function-calling capabilities for domain-specific operations
- **Python Backend**: Handling AI agent conversational flow

### Frontend
- **React Native**: Cross-platform mobile application framework
- **Expo**: Toolchain for React Native development

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into four main directories:

- **spring-boot-backend/**: Java-based backend API with comprehensive hotel management services
- **ai-agent/**: Python implementation of the conversational AI system that guides users through booking
- **react-native-ui/**: Mobile application frontend built with React Native and Expo
- **ai-recommend-system/**: Room recommendation system based on user preferences

## AI Agent Integration

The most distinctive feature of this project is the conversational AI agent that enables users to complete an end-to-end hotel reservation through natural language. The agent can:

- Guide users through selecting cities, hotels, and rooms
- Handle date selection and availability checking
- Process user information for booking
- Complete transactions
- Answer questions about hotels and amenities
- Provide personalized recommendations

### How It Works

1. The user initiates a conversation with the AI agent
2. The agent directs the conversation flow to gather necessary booking information
3. Behind the scenes, the agent calls specific functions that interact with the backend API
4. The booking process is completed when all required information is collected
5. Confirmation details are provided to the user

```python
# Example of tool integration in the AI agent
def otel_sec(otel_id: int) -> dict:
    """Selects a hotel with the given ID and retrieves its detailed information.

    Args:
        otel_id (int): The ID of the hotel to select.

    Returns:
        dict: Operation result containing hotel information or error message.
    """
    # Implementation details...
```

The conversational flow is managed through a set of tools that handle different aspects of the booking process. These tools are registered with the AI agent and are called when appropriate during the conversation:

```python
root_agent = Agent(
    name="otel_rezervasyon_asistani",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    description="Bu asistan, otel arama, rezervasyon yapma, otel bilgilerini sağlama ve etkinlik rezervasyonları konusunda yardımcı olur.",
    instruction=AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS,
    tools=[
        sehir_sec,
        fiyat_araligi_belirle,
        tarihleri_belirle,
        kisi_oda_sayisi,
        otelleri_listele,
        otel_detay,
        oda_musaitligi_kontrol,
        otel_sec,
        oda_sec,
        rezervasyon_tamamla,
        rezervasyon_bilgilerini_temizle,
        # Additional tools...
    ]
)
```

## Spring Boot Backend

The backend implements a comprehensive API for hotel management, including:

- Hotel and room management
- Reservation processing and management
- User authentication and authorization with Keycloak
- Availability checking and pricing
- Activity and event management

### Data Model

The core entities in the system include:

```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "hotels")
public class Hotel {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;
    private String name;
    private String city;
    private String address;
    private String description;
    private Double pricePerNight;
    private Integer totalRooms;
    private Integer availableRooms;
    // Relationships and methods...
}
```

Other key entities include:
- **Room**: Contains room details, availability status, and amenities
- **Reservation**: Tracks booking information, dates, and guest details
- **Activity**: Represents hotel activities or excursions that can be booked
- **ActivityReservation**: Manages reservations for specific activities
- **User**: Stores user information and authentication details

### API Endpoints

The REST API provides comprehensive endpoints for all booking operations:

#### Hotel Management
```
GET    /api/hotels                      # List hotels with optional filtering
GET    /api/hotels/{id}                 # Get hotel details
POST   /api/hotels                      # Create a new hotel
PUT    /api/hotels/{id}                 # Update hotel details
DELETE /api/hotels/{id}                 # Delete a hotel

```

#### Room Management
```

POST   /api/activity-reservations       # Book an activity
```

### Security Implementation

The system uses Keycloak for secure authentication and authorization with OAuth 2.0 and JWT:

```java
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
@EnableMethodSecurity
public class SecurityConfig {

    private final JwtAuthConverter jwtAuthConverter;

    public SecurityConfig(JwtAuthConverter jwtAuthConverter) {
        this.jwtAuthConverter = jwtAuthConverter;
    }

    @Bean
    public SecurityFilterChain securityFilterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .cors(cors -> cors.configurationSource(corsConfigurationSource()))
            .authorizeHttpRequests(authz -> authz
                .requestMatchers("/api/auth/**")
                .permitAll()
                .anyRequest().authenticated()
            )
            .csrf(AbstractHttpConfigurer::disable);
        
        http.oauth2ResourceServer(server -> server.jwt(jwtConfigurer -> 
            jwtConfigurer.jwtAuthenticationConverter(jwtAuthConverter)));
        
        http.sessionManagement(management -> 
            management.sessionCreationPolicy(SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS));
        
        return http.build();
    }
    
    // CORS configuration...
}
```

The JWT authentication is handled by a custom converter that extracts roles from Keycloak tokens:

```java
@Component
public class JwtAuthConverter implements Converter<Jwt, AbstractAuthenticationToken> {
    // Configuration properties and converters

    @Override
    public AbstractAuthenticationToken convert(@NonNull Jwt jwt) {
        Collection<GrantedAuthority> authorities = Stream.concat(
                jwtGrantedAuthoritiesConverter.convert(jwt).stream(),
                extractResourceRoles(jwt).stream()
        ).collect(Collectors.toSet());

        return new JwtAuthenticationToken(
                jwt,
                authorities,
                getPrincipleClaimName(jwt)
        );
    }

    // Methods to extract claims and roles from JWT...
}
```

The security system provides:

- OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect protocols
- Role-based access control
- JWT token management and validation
- Fine-grained authorization at endpoint level
- Single sign-on capabilities
- Integration with multiple clients (mobile app, web app)
